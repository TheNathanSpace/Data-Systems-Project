## A Suffix-Tree-Based Database for Sequence Alignment

`mstrdb`, short for Mines Suffix Tree Database, is a database that constructs suffix trees on-disk for more efficient
sequence alignment. See [the report](https://github.com/TheNathanSpace/mstrdb/blob/main/mstrdb.pdf) for a more detailed explanation.

A sample usage can be seen in `main.py`.
